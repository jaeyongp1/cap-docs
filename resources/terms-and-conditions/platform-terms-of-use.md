   By using the Platform, Website, or Service, User agrees to, and is bound by, the terms of Company’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement as if it were set forth herein in its entirety. The Privacy Policy describes how Company collects, uses, and discloses information provided by User.
5. COMMUNICATION WITH USERS\
   User affirms that it is aware of and acknowledges that Company is a Blockchain service provider and has designed the Platform to be directly accessible by Users without any involvement or actions taken by Company or any third-party.
6. THIRD-PARTY LINKS, PRODUCTS, AND APPLICATIONS\
   6.1 Third-Party Sites. The Website may contain links to websites controlled or operated by persons and companies other than Company (“Linked Sites”), including but not limited to any sites related to digital transactions occasionally hyperlinked, such as X, Discord, Discourse, Gitbook, and Telegram, and websites referencing or supporting Blockchain Technology projects, marketplaces, and trading platforms. Linked Sites are not under the control of Company, and Company is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site, including without limitation any link contained on a Linked Site, or any changes or updates to a Linked Site. Company is not responsible if the Linked Site is not working correctly or for any viruses, malware, or other harms resulting from User’s use of a Linked Site. Company is providing these links to User only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any\
   link does not imply endorsement by Company of the site or any association with its operators. User is responsible for viewing and abiding by the privacy policies and terms of use posted on the Linked Sites. User is solely responsible for any dealings with third parties who support Company or are identified on the Website, including any delivery of and payment for goods and services. Company does not store any information shared with a Linked Site and is not responsible for any personally identifiable information shared with any Linked Site.\
   6.2 Third-Party Smart Contracts. User acknowledges and understands that Company uses certain\
   third-party Smart Contracts that it has no ownership of, or control over, which are core components of the Platform. Company is not responsible for any coding errors, glitches, or any functionality, or lack thereof, of such third-party Smart Contracts.\
   6.3 Release. To the fullest extent permitted by law, User hereby releases and forever discharges Company (and its Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waives and relinquishes, each and every past, present, and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Platform (including any interactions\
   with, or act or omission of, Company’s partners or any other third-party or any Linked Sites). IF USER IS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, USER HEREBY WAIVES CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
7. THE PLATFORM\
   7.1 Purpose of the Platform and Website. The Platform is a fully decentralized lending protocol. The\
   Platform allows Users to mint cUSD by staking USDC or USDT. Similarly, the Platform can provide liquidity to Users by allowing Users to borrow from the collateral pool. Stakers and restakers can earn yield by providing collateral to the Platform’s pools. The Website is provided for Users to access the Platform, use the Service, and to provide updates about the CAP Ecosystem to Users.\
   7.2 Website Content. Company does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this\
   information at any particular time for any particular purpose. Any reliance User places on such information is strictly at User’s own risk. Company disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such content by User, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents.\
   7.3 Use of the Website, Platform and Service; Licenses. Subject to this Agreement, Company grants User a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use the Platform, including the Website and the data, material, content, or information herein (collectively, the “Content”) solely for User’s personal use. User’s right to access and use the same shall be limited to the purposes described in these Terms unless User is otherwise expressly authorized by Company, in writing, to use the Platform for User’s own commercial purposes. User agrees to use the Platform only for lawful purposes, comply with all rules governing any\
   transactions on and through the Platform and comply with the law. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved, and no license or right to use any trademark of Company or any third-party is granted to User.\
   7.4 Additional Considerations\
   (a) Transactions Are Recorded on Public Blockchains. The transactions that take place on the\
   Platform are managed and confirmed via public Blockchains. User understands that its Wallet address will be made publicly visible whenever it engages in a transaction on the Platform. Company does not own or control any Blockchain that Company chooses to interface with, or any other third-party site, product, or service that User might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling User to access and utilize the various features of the Platform. Company is not liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, and will not be liable for any damage that a User may suffer as a result of its transactions or any other interaction with any such third\
   parties.\
   (b) Gas. All transactions on the Platform are facilitated by Smart Contracts. Public Blockchains\
   require the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on its network, and thus every transaction occurring on the Platform. The value of the Gas Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of Company or the Platform. User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a transaction on the Platform be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to User.\
   7.5 Prohibitions and Restrictions\
   (a) Prohibited Uses. User agrees that it will not:\
   (i) Use the Platform or the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or\
   impair the Website or the Platform or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the same;\
   (ii) Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any website or platform, computer systems, or\
   networks associated with Company, the Platform, or the Website;\
   (iii) Obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through the Website by any\
   means not intentionally made available or provided by Company;\
   (iv) Use any robot, spider, or other automatic device, process or means to access the Website\
   for any purpose, including monitoring or copying any of the material on the Website;\
   (v) Introduce any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or other material which is\
   malicious or technologically harmful;\
   (vi) Send unsolicited messages or use the Website to send unsolicited messages such as spam;\
   (vii) Perform any benchmark tests or analyses related to the Website or the Platform without\
   express written permission of Company;\
   (viii) Send spam or engage in phishing. Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings,\
   contact requests, or similar electronic communications. Phishing is sending emails or other electronic communications to fraudulently or unlawfully induce recipients to reveal personal or sensitive information, such as passwords, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, credit card information, financial information, or other sensitive information, or to gain access to Wallets or records, exfiltration of documents or other sensitive information, payment and/or financial benefit;\
   (ix) Attack the Website or the Platform via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed\
   denial-of-service attack;\
   (x) Impersonate or attempt to impersonate Company, a Company employee, another User or\
   any other person or entity (including, without limitation, by using email addresses associated with any of the foregoing);\
   (xi) License, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially\
   exploit the Service, whether in whole or in part, or any Content displayed on the Service except as\
   permitted herein;\
   (xii) Modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer any\
   part of the Service or the Platform; or\
   (xiii) Access the Platform in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or\
   service.\
   (b) Restrictions. Except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Platform may be copied,\
   reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted, or transmitted in any form or by any means. Unless otherwise indicated, any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Platform will be subject to this Agreement. All copyright and other proprietary notices related to the Platform (including on any Content displayed on the Website) must be retained on all copies thereof. User will not use the Website or Platform for any illegal purpose.\
   7.6 Modification. Company reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Platform\
   (in whole or in part) with or without notice to Users. User agrees that Company will not be liable to User or to any third-party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Platform or any part thereof.\
   7.7 Affiliates. The rights, duties and/or obligations of Company under this Agreement may be exercised and/or performed by Company and/or any of Company’s Affiliates, or any of their subcontractors and/or agents. User agrees that any claim or action arising out of or related to any act or omission of any of Company or its Affiliates, or any of their respective subcontractors or agents, related to the subject matter hereof, shall only be brought against Company, and not against any of Company’s Affiliates, licensors, or any subcontractor or agent of Company or any\
   its Affiliates.
8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\
   8.1 Company Intellectual Property. The contents of the Platform, including the Website, are intended for User’s personal, noncommercial use. User acknowledges and agrees that Company (or, as applicable, Company’s licensors) owns all legal right, title, and interest in and to all elements of the Platform, Company’s logo, graphics, design, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, “look and feel,” organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the Platform (collectively, the “Company Materials”). The\
   Website, Platform, Company Materials, and Content are protected by copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, database\
   rights, sui generis rights and other intellectual or proprietary rights therein pursuant to U.S. and international laws.\
   Accordingly, User is not permitted to use the Website or Content in any manner, except as expressly permitted by\
   Company in these Terms. The Website or Content may not be copied, reproduced, modified, published, uploaded,\
   posted, transmitted, performed, or distributed in any way, and User agrees not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,\
   distribute, transmit, broadcast, or create derivatives without the express written consent of Company. Except as\
   expressly set forth herein, User’s use of the Platform does not grant User ownership of or any other rights with\
   respect to any Content, code, data, or other materials that User may access on or through the Platform. Company\
   reserves all rights in and to Company Materials not expressly granted to Users in the Terms.\
   User may not use any of Company’s Content to link to the Website or Content without Company’s express written\
   consent. User may not use framing techniques to enclose any such Content without Company’s express written\
   consent. In addition, the “look and feel” of the Website and Content, including without limitation, all page headers,\
   custom graphics, button icons, and scripts constitute the service mark, trademark, or trade dress of Company and may\
   not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without Company’s prior written consent.\
   8.2 Non-Company Intellectual Property. Excluding Company Materials, all other trademarks, product\
   names, logos, and similar intellectual property on the Platform are the property of their respective owners and may\
   not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without the permission of the applicable owner.\
   8.3 Aggregate Data. Company shall have the right to collect and analyze data and other information relating\
   to provision and use of various aspects of the Platform. Company will be free to (i) use the data to improve and\
   enhance the Service and for other development, diagnostic, and corrective purposes in connection with the Platform\
   and (ii) disclose data solely in aggregate or other de-identified form in connection with its business.
9. INDEMNIFICATION\
   User agrees to release, indemnify, and hold harmless Company and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,\
   employees and agents, from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without\
   limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to: (a) User’s access to, use of, or\
   inability to use the Platform, the Website, or Service; (b) User’s breach of this Agreement; (c) User’s violation of any\
   rights of a third party; (d) User’s violation of any Applicable Law; and (e) any and all financial losses User may suffer, or\
   cause others to suffer, due to utilizing, transferring, staking, or re-staking cryptocurrency, or any other digital assets.
10. ASSUMPTION OF RISK\
    10.1 User Acknowledges the Risk of Cryptocurrency and Smart Contracts. USER REPRESENTS AND\
    WARRANTS THAT IT UNDERSTANDS AND IS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH\
    CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS SUCH AS SMART CONTRACTS, THRID PARTY BRIDGES, PUBLIC\
    BLOCKCHAINS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN), LIQUIDITY\
    PROTOCOLS, AND THE INTERPLANETARY FILE SYSTEM.\
    10.2 Company is Not Responsible for Technical Errors on Any Blockchain. COMPANY IS NOT\
    RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM THE USE OF BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES\
    OF ANY BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OR WALLET THAT COMPANY OR USER MAY INTERFACE WITH,\
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO\
    REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH A BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OR ANY ASSOCIATED LAYER 2\
    BLOCKCHAINS THAT COMPANY OR USER MAY INTERFACE WITH, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL\
    NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES RESULTING IN LOSS OF FUNDS.\
    10.3 User Acknowledges the Risks of the Platform. User acknowledges that the Platform is subject to flaws\
    and that User is solely responsible for evaluating any information provided by the Platform. This warning and others\
    provided in this Agreement by Company in no way evidence or represent an ongoing duty to alert User to all of the\
    potential risks of utilizing or accessing the Platform. The Platform may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks,\
    cryptocurrency based economic exploits, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties\
    that may cause interruptions to or delays on the Platform. The Platform utilizes shared security marketplaces like\
    EigenLayer, accordingly, the User may be exposed to the risks associated with such platforms. User agrees to accept\
    the risk of the Platform failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those\
    resulting from sophisticated attacks, and User agrees that it will not hold Company accountable for any related losses.\
    Company will not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any viruses that may\
    affect User’s computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack.\
    10.4 Company Does Not Make Any Representations Regarding the Value of Cryptocurrency or Other\
    Digital Assets. The prices of blockchain assets, including USDT and USDC, are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in\
    the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of cryptocurrency, which may also be\
    subject to significant price volatility. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed\
    ecosystems could negatively impact the development, potential utility, or value of cryptocurrency. The CAP\
    Ecosystem and other digital assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions. For\
    all of the foregoing reasons, as well as for reasons that may not presently be known to Company, Company makes\
    absolutely no representations or warranties of any kind regarding the value of cryptocurrency or other digital assets.\
    10.5 User Acknowledges Financial Risk of Digital Assets. The risk of loss associated with the use of digital\
    assets can be substantial. User should, therefore, carefully consider whether creating, buying, selling, or otherwise\
    using digital assets is suitable for User in light of its circumstances and financial resources. By using the Platform,\
    accessing the Website, and/or purchasing cryptocurrency, User represents that it has been, is and will be solely\
    responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the\
    underlying digital assets. User represents that it has sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice,\
    and experience to make its own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted via any digital asset.\
    Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any portion of the Platform be deemed to create a relationship\
    that includes the provision or tendering of investment advice.\
    10.6 Company is Not Responsible for Losses Due to Jurisdictional Blocks. User acknowledges that\
    Company has no control over jurisdictional blocks which may prevent User from utilizing the Website. Under no\
    circumstances will Company be liable for User’s inability to access the Website due to a jurisdictional block.\
    10.7 Violations by Other Users. User irrevocably releases, acquits, and forever discharges Company and its\
    subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, and successors for and against any and all past or future causes of action, suits, or\
    controversies arising out of another User’s violation of these Terms.
11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER\
    11.1 Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL\
    COMPANY (OR COMPANY’S AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE TO USER OR ANY THIRD-PARTY FOR ANY\
    FINANCIAL LOSS, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE\
    PRODUCTS, OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR\
    PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR USER’S USE OF, OR\
    INABILITY TO USE, THE PLATFORM, THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICE, CONTENT OR INFORMATION\
    ACCESSED VIA THE WEBSITE OR ANY HYPERLINKED WEBSITE, OR ANY DISRUPTION OR DELAY IN\
    THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WEBSITE, THE PLATFORM, OR THE SERVICE EVEN IF COMPANY HAS\
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE PLATFORM\
    IS AT USER’S OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND USER WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY\
    MONETARY LOSS AND/OR DAMAGE TO ITS DEVICE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM, OR LOSS OF DATA\
    RESULTING THEREFROM.\
    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR\
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY\
    NOT APPLY TO USER.\
    11.2 No Warranties. ALL INFORMATION OR SERVICE PROVIDED BY COMPANY TO USER VIA THE\
    WEBSITE AND THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL CONTENT, IS PROVIDED\
    “AS IS” AND “WHERE IS” AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. COMPANY AND ANY\
    THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS WITH CONTENT ON THE WEBSITE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL\
    WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\
    THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND\
    NON-INFRINGEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE\
    CONTRARY, COMPANY AND AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT\
    CONCERNING THE ACCURACY, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, COMPLETENESS, SEQUENCE, TIMELINESS,\
    SECURITY OR AVAILABILITY OF THE WEBSITE, THE PLATFORM OR ANY CONTENT POSTED ON OR\
    OTHERWISE ACCESSIBLE VIA THE PLATFORM OR THE WEBSITE. USER SPECIFICALLY\
    ACKNOWLEDGES THAT COMPANY AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DEFAMATORY,\
    OBSCENE OR UNLAWFUL CONDUCT OF THIRD-PARTIES OR USERS OF THE WEBSITE OR THE\
    PLATFORM AND THAT THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH USER.\
    NEITHER COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES REPRESENT, WARRANT, OR COVENANT THAT THE\
    WEBSITE AND/OR THE PLATFORM WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. COMPANY\
    FURTHER MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE WEBSITE WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES, WORMS, OR\
    TROJAN HORSES OR THAT IT WILL FUNCTION OR OPERATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANY OTHER\
    PRODUCT OR SOFTWARE. USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE PLATFORM IS AT USER’S\
    SOLE RISK AND THAT COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS SHALL NOT\
    BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY TERMINATION, INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE, DELAYS, ERRORS,\
    FAILURES OF PERFORMANCE, DEFECTS, OR OMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEBSITE AND/OR\
    THE PLATFORM OR USER’S USE THEREOF. USER’S SOLE REMEDY AGAINST COMPANY FOR\
    DISSATISFACTION WITH THE WEBSITE, THE PLATFORM, OR THE CONTENT IS TO CEASE ITS USE OF\
    THE PLATFORM AND THE WEBSITE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OR\
    LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO USER.\
    USER MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY BY JURISDICTION. WHEN THE IMPLIED\
    WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE EXCLUDED IN THEIR ENTIRETY, USER AGREES THAT\
    THEY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT AND SHORTEST DURATION PERMITTED BY\
    LAW.
12. TERM AND TERMINATION\
    This Agreement will remain in full force and effect while User uses the Platform, the Website, or the Service (the “Term”).\
    Company may suspend or terminate User’s rights to use the Platform, the Website, or the Service at any time for any\
    reason at Company’s sole discretion, including for any use of the Website, the Platform, or the Service in violation of this\
    Agreement. User may terminate this Agreement at any time by ending User’s use of the Platform and notifying Company\
    at info@coveredagents.com. Such notice to Company must include User’s Wallet address(es). Upon termination of User’s\
    rights under this Agreement, User’s right to access and use the Platform will terminate immediately. Company will not\
    have any liability whatsoever to User for any termination of User’s rights under this Agreement. All provisions of the\
    Agreement which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of Service, including without limitation,\
    ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.
13. GENERAL TERMS\
    13.1 General Terms. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly\
    incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between User\
    and Company regarding User’s use of the Service. User may not assign or transfer these Terms or its rights under\
    these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without Company’s prior written consent.\
    Company may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any\
    provision will not affect Company’s right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by\
    Company of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent\
    breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only\
    and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word\
    “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable,\
    the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full\
    force and effect.\
    13.2 Electronic Communications. By using the Website, the Platform, or the Service, User consents to\
    receiving certain electronic communications from Company as further described in the Privacy Policy. Please read\
    the Privacy Policy to learn more about Company’s electronic communications practices. User agrees that any notices,\
    agreements, disclosures, or other communications that Company sends to User electronically will satisfy any legal\
    communication requirements. Any electronic communications will be deemed to have been received by User\
    immediately after Company posts the same to the Website, whether or not User has received or retrieved the\
    communication from Company. User agrees that these are reasonable procedures for sending and receiving electronic\
    communications. If User wish to withdraw User’s consent to receive Communications electronically, User must\
    discontinue use of the Platform. Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to discontinue the provision of\
    electronic communications, or to terminate or change the terms and conditions on which Company provides\
    electronic communications. Company will provide User with notice of any such termination or change as required by\
    Applicable Law.\
    13.3 Changes to these Terms of Use. Company may update or change these Terms from time to time in order\
    to reflect changes in any offered services, changes in the law, or for other reasons as deemed necessary by Company.\
    The effective date of any Terms will be reflected in the “Last Revised” entry at the top of these Terms. User’s\
    continued use of the Website after any such change is communicated shall constitute User’s consent to such\
    change(s).\
    13.4 Governing Law & Jurisdiction. These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Panama,\
    without regard to its conflict of law principles. User hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and\
    venue of the competent courts of the Republic of Panama for all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the\
    Platform, the Website, or the Service not subject to the Arbitration Agreement outlined in Section 14.5.\
    13.5 Dispute Resolution\
    (a) Arbitration Agreement Generally. Please read the following arbitration agreement (“Arbitration\
    Agreement”) carefully. It limits the manner in which User may seek relief from Company, is part of User’s\
    contract with Company, and contains provisions concerning MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND\
    WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\
    (b) Exceptions. Nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the\
    right of either party to seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration or to file suit in a court of law\
    to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\
    (c) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In the interest of resolving disputes between Company\
    and User in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, and except as set forth in Section 14.5(b), User and\
    Company agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms that cannot be resolved informally,\
    whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, including any\
    unresolved dispute, claim, interpretation, controversy, or issues of public policy arising out of or relating to the\
    Website, the Platform, the Service, these Terms, and the determination of the scope or applicability of this\
    Section 14.5 will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration\
    Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration\
    Agreement applies to User and Company, and to any subsidiaries, Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors\
    in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services\
    or goods provided under the Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all\
    disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement\
    or any prior version of this Agreement.\
    (d) Arbitration Rules. Arbitration will be conducted and administered by the Center for Conciliation\
    and Arbitration of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries, and Agriculture of Panama (“CeCAP”) and its\
    dispute resolution rules (“CeCAP Rules”), as modified by these Terms. The CeCAP rules are available online\
    at https://cecap.com.pa/en/reglamento-de-cecap/, or by contacting Company. A single arbitrator will be\
    appointed unless otherwise required by the CeCAP rules.\
    (e) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration,\
    the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and\
    basis of the claim or dispute, and the specific relief requested. A Notice to Company should be sent by certified\
    U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) to:\
    Covered Agents S.A.\
    c/o Pacifica Legal\
    Boulevard Costa del Este, PH Financial Park Tower, Piso 17\
    OV320 Ciudad de Panamá\
    Panamá\
    Company may send User a Notice by electronic mail if User has provided Company with such an address.\
    Company may also provide Notice to User’s Wallet by sending an NFT to User’s Wallet. After the Notice is\
    received, User and Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If User and Company do\
    not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an\
    arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise\
    agreed by the parties in writing.\
    (f) Fees; Location. Each party shall be responsible for the payment of its own fees and costs\
    associated with an arbitration, except as otherwise required by the CeCAP Rules. Any arbitration hearing will\
    take place in Panama City, Panama, or another location mutually agreed upon by the parties; provided,\
    however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties shall endeavor, where possible, to cause the arbitration\
    proceeding to be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; or (ii) through a\
    non-appearance-based telephone hearing or videoconference. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of\
    User’s claim or the relief sought in User’s arbitration demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose,\
    in the arbitrator’s reasonable discretion, then the payment of all arbitration fees will be governed by the\
    CeCAP Rules. In that case, User agrees to reimburse Company for all monies previously disbursed by\
    Company that are otherwise User’s obligation to pay under the CeCAP Rules. Regardless of the manner in\
    which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the\
    essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. Notwithstanding\
    anything herein to the contrary, each party will be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees associated with an\
    arbitration under these Terms, and in no event may the arbitrator award any party their attorneys’ fees.\
    (g) Enforcement. The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of\
    competent jurisdiction with respect to this section to compel arbitration, to confirm an arbitration award or\
    order, or to handle court functions permitted under the CeCAP Rules. The parties irrevocably waive defense of\
    an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or other proceeding. The parties may seek\
    recognition and enforcement of any court judgment confirming an arbitration award or order in any court\
    having jurisdiction with respect to recognition or enforcement of such judgment.\
    (h) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND\
    STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY,\
    instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\
    Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court\
    and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between User and\
    Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, USER\
    AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by\
    a judge.\
    (i) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE\
    SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE\
    ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND\
    CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED\
    JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\
    (j) Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be\
    invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no\
    force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full\
    force and effect.\
    (k) Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement\
    may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other\
    portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\
    13.6 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. In the event a party files an action in a court of competent jurisdiction\
    pursuant to Section 14.5(b), the party found to be the substantially losing party in any dispute shall be required to pay\
    the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of any party determined to be the substantially prevailing party. In the\
    context of this Agreement, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs shall include but not be limited to legal fees and\
    costs, the fees and costs of witnesses, accountants, experts, and other professionals, and any other forum costs\
    incurred during, or in preparation for, a dispute. It is understood that certain time entries that may appear in the\
    billing records of such party’s legal counsel may be redacted to protect attorney-client or work-product privilege, and\
    this will not prevent recovery for the associated billings.\
    13.7 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall bind and inure\
    to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or\
    implied, is intended to confer upon any person, other than the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, any\
    of the rights hereunder.\
    13.8 No Support or Maintenance. User acknowledges and agrees that Company will have no obligation to\
    provide User with any support or maintenance in connection with the Platform, Website, or Service.
