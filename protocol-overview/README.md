Cap is a three-sided marketplace designed to run autonomously via economic incentives. Cap outsources the generation of yield via a diverse layer of institutional operators ranging from banks, HFT firms, and market makers. The trust marketplace of Shared Security Networks enables Cap to generate perpetual competitive yield under any market conditions.
